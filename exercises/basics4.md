## Objects

1. Create a class called Ingredient.
Each instance of this class represents a single ingredient.
The instance should keep track of an ingredientâ€™s name and its cost.
Tip: if properties of the class are private you need to provide appropriate methods to get their values
2. Add a method to your Ingredient class that changes the cost of an ingredient.
3. Make a class Dish that accepts multiple Ingredient objects to specify the ingredients.
Tip: Think of a data structure that can hold multiple objects of the Ingredient class
Tip: Consider using 'instanceof' to check passed objects to Dish constructor
4. Give your Dish class a method that returns the total cost of the Dish.
5. Provide an example of two Dishes constructed with different Ingridients.
6. Try to organize your code in distinct files: one class per file. Use 'require_once' to include them.
